# Panimalar Grocery Web Store Application

## Introduction
The **Panimalar Grocery Web Store Application** is an online platform designed to offer a seamless grocery shopping experience. It allows users to browse, search, and purchase a wide range of grocery items from the convenience of their devices. The application is built using the MERN stack, integrating MongoDB for database management, Express.js and Node.js for backend services, and React.js for frontend development. This application ensures user-friendly navigation, a fast shopping experience, and secure transactions.

## Project Definition and Scope
